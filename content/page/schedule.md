## (Canceled) October 17, 2021, 1:00 PM, Giant City State Park, Shelter 2

We'll be seeking nominations for 2022 officers and possibly get a visit from our financial benefits counselor to learn about the  financial products Sons of Norway offers.
A presentation on [Leif Erikson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leif_Erikson) will presented in honor of [Leif Erikson Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leif_Erikson_Day) (October 9).
We have the shelter all day, from 8:00 AM until dusk, so feel free to come early and do a little hiking before the meeting; don't forget to count the hike towards a sports medal!
