Every year we make [lefse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefse),

> Lefse is a traditional soft Norwegian flatbread. It is made with potatoes (often, but not always), flour, butter, and milk or cream. It is cooked on a large, flat griddle. Special tools are used to prepare lefse, including long wooden turning sticks and special rolling pins with deep grooves.

It's almost like a flour tortilla but softer and tastier and Norwegian!

Consider [joining](https://members.sofn.com/newMembers/signup/join?district=5&lodge=689&lodgeName=Shawnee+Skogen+++++++++++) our lodge so you can learn to make lefse and all sorts of other Scandinavian art, food, etc.

Our annual lefse making meeting will be November 15, 2020 at 2:00 PM.

Here's the recipe we will use,

- 9 cup hot water
- 3 sticks butter (2 butter, 1 margarine)
- 5 tsp. salt
- 3 Tbsp. sugar
- 3 cup dried milk
- 9 cup potato flakes (Idaho or Hungry Jack)

1. Mix above together real good. I use a mixer. Put in covered rectangular container. Cool overnight.
2. Divide into thirds. Knead in 1 1/2 cup flour in each 1/3. Then make it into a roll about 2 1/2" diameter.
3. Cut in half, each half in half, and so on until you have 16 patties (in each 1/3).
4. Roll and put on grill.

This recipe will make 48 patties.
