Every year Norwegians celebrate [Constitution Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Day_(Norway)) often referred to just as "syttende mai" ("Seventeenth May").
In Norway the day will feature children's parades all over the country, memorials to those fallen in wars, and russ.
Men, women, and children often wear traditional outfits called [bunad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunad) or wear red, white and blue ribbons and carry flags.
Around the world Norwegian communities celebrate with traditional foods and in some cases putting on their own parades and festivities.

This year we will not only be celebrating syttende mai but also our postponed julebord!
Normally julebord would happen in early December but because of COVID-19 we postponed it.
With vaccinations being widely available and with our May 16th meeting being planned outdoors at Giant City State Park we think it will be safe to come together to celebrate syttende mai and our postponed julebord!

We will be at Shelter 3 right beside the [Giant City Nature Trail trailhead](https://goo.gl/maps/NaZRQjqRGXTEknjB9) at 2PM.
