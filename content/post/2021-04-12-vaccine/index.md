According to the [State of Illinois Coronavirus Response](https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/s/vaccination-plan-overview) any Illinois resident age 16 and up will be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine on April 12th.
For many of us this is a major milestone on the road to returning to normal and offers hope to being able to resume in-person lodge meetings.
Between vaccines being available and the weather allowing us to meet outdoors we hope to see familiar faces in-person soon!
