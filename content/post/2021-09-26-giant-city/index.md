For September we met at Giant City State Park and the weather was absolutely sublime.
After taking care of the formal lodge meeting we continued on with a [presentation](royals.pdf) from Wendy about the state and relations of the royal families of Europe.

After the presentation we played a game of [Kubb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubb) which purports to be an ancient Viking game.
It was introduced to our lodge via [Nordic Fest](https://nordicfest.com) which sometimes hosts a Kubb tournament.
This photo only captures one team but the game was played 6 vs. 6,

Finally, Ron donned the troll costume so we could take some pictures for Viking magazine.
