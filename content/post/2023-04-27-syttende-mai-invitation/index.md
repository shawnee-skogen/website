Every year Norwegians celebrate [Constitution Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Day_(Norway)), often referred to just as "syttende mai" ("Seventeenth May").
In Norway the day will feature children's parades all over the country, memorials to those fallen in wars, and russ.
Men, women, and children often wear traditional outfits called [bunad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunad) or wear red, white and blue ribbons and carry flags.
Around the world Norwegian communities celebrate with traditional foods and in some cases putting on their own parades and festivities.

This year we will be enjoying a potluck hosted at Ron Naversen's house.
Please RSVP to rnaversen@gmail.com with how many are attending and what you are bringing for the potluck!
