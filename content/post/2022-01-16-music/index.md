The story behind [Solfager om Ormekongen](https://youtu.be/pU1JlSLLGos),

> The great Ormekongen (The Worm King) falls in love with a beautiful maid named Solfager and desperately wants her for his own. Solfager, however, is engaged to David, and as such Ormekongen conjures up a cunning plan. He gives Solafager an anesthetic drink, causing her to fall into a deep sleep. It is quickly assumed that Solafager has died, and David and his folk proceed to bury the beautiful Solfager. Once buried, Ormekongen visits Solfager’s grave and gives her a choice: She can die there alone or join him without anyone suspecting she is under his command. Fearing for her life Solfager chooses to join Ormekongen. David soon learns that she is alive and comes to her rescue and kills Ormekongen. As such, David’s love for Solafager does not only release her from a life in barbaric captivity, but he also conquers death and proves that true love is eternal.”

And the lyrics to Solfager om Ormekongen,

> David kongjen kom seg riand i går  
> Solfager to ute og sola sitt hår
>
> Han støypte gullkrossen i solfagers hond,  
> At ho sill` vera kjend på fremminde lond
>
> Ormekongjen kom seg riand i går 
> Solfager sto ute, ho sola sitt hår
>
> Så gav han henne dei dvaledrykkjin` tri  
> Solfager ho dåna, då ho fekk di
>
> Kongen let seg pilmrimsklæ`i skjera  
> Liksom ein pilgrim han vera
>
> Solfager ho lyfte på pilgrimshatt  
> «Er du kongjen, du seie meg satt.»
