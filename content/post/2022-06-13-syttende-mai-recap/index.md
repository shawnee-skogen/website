Gratulerer med dagen!
The weather gave us a reprieve and we were able to enjoy a wonderful picnic with many of our lodge members.
In Norwegian tradition, hot dogs were grilled and we attempted to serve ice cream.
There was a wonderful variety of dishes, some of which were made possible thanks to the Charmans' RV kitchenette.
We enjoyed seeing several lodge members we have not seen in a while!

The festivities took place at Giant City State Park where we had a nice shelter to give us some shade.
In addition to the meeting and potluck/picnic there was also some hiking, some baseball, and some Kubb.
