Gratulerer med dagen!
The weather gave us a reprieve and we were able to enjoy a wonderful picnic with our many of our lodge members.
In Norwegian tradition hot dogs were grilled and we attempted to serve ice cream.
There was a wonderful variety of dishes, some of which were made possible thanks to the Charmans' RV kitchenette.
We got to see several lodge members we have not gotten to see in a while!

The festivities took place at Giant City State Park where we had this nice shelter to give us some shade,
