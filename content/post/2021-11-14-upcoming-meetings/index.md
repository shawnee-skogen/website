Our annual lefse meeting is next week, the 21st, starting around noon at Wendy & Bill's home.
If you're interesting in making a batch of lefse dough please let Wendy know; we'll need a few batches made.
We'll have at least two stations setup, maybe three.
Kids and adults can participate and there's a deck, a yard, etc. for folks to enjoy.
Lefse can be frozen and used year-round.
It can be enjoyed by your family or sold as a fundraiser for the lodge.

Then on December 12th we'll have our annual Julebord potluck.
Bring your favorite Scandinavian dish and enjoy others'!

Come chat, eat, and enjoy each others company!
