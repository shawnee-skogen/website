Eleven of us met up at the [Old Herald Brewery & Distillery](https://www.oldheraldbrewing.com) for lunch before heading over to the [Cahokia Mounds][1] ([Wikipedia][2]).
There a few more joined in, bringing us to sixteen, where we got to enjoy a special guided tour.
It was a hot day and the shade was appreciated but it did not diminish the experience.
Our tour guide offered much wisdom in introducing us to the Mississippian culture of this ancient city that existed around 1050-1350 CE.
However, rolling in on the heels of the guided tour were some thunderstorms which prevented us from hiking up Monks Mound.
We finished off the guided tour and headed into the then extremely welcoming, air conditioned museum.
Cahokia Mounds is a very interesting archaeological site that is well worth a stop if you are interested in the regions history.

Our next meeting is planned for August 22nd and will be in Centralia, IL where we will get to enjoy the sights of the [Centralia Balloon Fest][0].
