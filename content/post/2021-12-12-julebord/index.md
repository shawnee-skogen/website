Last Sunday, December 12th, we had our annual Julebord potluck.
We got to enjoy many tasty dishes and desserts, check out the [2021 Julebord photo album](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0oJEsNWnJ0Wmxf) to see some of them.
We enjoyed some discussion, some shared traditions, and, completely unrelated, some VR gaming.

We wish everyone a merry Christmas and happy holidays!

Please enjoy this youth choir's julesangen, "God Jul Til Alle",
