      <description>Overview We are Shawnee Skogen, Sons of Norway Lodge 5-689. Sons of Norway is a fraternal benefit society that was founded in 1895 to protect members of Sons of Norway and their families from the financial hardships experienced during times of sickness or death in the family. Over time, the mission of Sons of Norway has expanded to include the preservation of Norwegian heritage and culture in our society. Sons of Norway no longer requires Norwegian ancestry and our lodge is open to all who wish to explore Scandinavian heritage and culture.</description>
