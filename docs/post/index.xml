      <description>One of our lodge members, Ann Dolan, is a flutist in The Metropolitan Orchestra of St. Louis so we visited on of their summer &amp;ldquo;Pop-Up Concerts&amp;rdquo; on June 5th. It was an absolutely blissful evening and very entertaining to listen to a concert from a few feet away. The theme of the concert was &amp;ldquo;Around the World&amp;rdquo; where one of the stops included a piece by Norwegian composer, Johannes Hanssen, called &amp;ldquo;Valdres March&amp;rdquo;; here is the performance,</description>

      <description>Gratulerer med dagen! The weather gave us a reprieve and we were able to enjoy a wonderful picnic with our many of our lodge members. In Norwegian tradition hot dogs were grilled and we attempted to serve ice cream. There was a wonderful variety of dishes, some of which were made possible thanks to the Charmans&#39; RV kitchenette. We got to see several lodge members we have not gotten to see in a while!</description>

      <title>Påskestradisjoner</title>
      <link>https://shawnee-skogen.com/p/2022-04-10-pasketradisjoner/</link>

      <description>Påskestradisjoner just means &amp;ldquo;Easter Traditions&amp;rdquo;. Even when the same holidays are celebrated in different cultures there are often little, interesting differences. Easter has its roots as a spring festival and from Christianity with the resurrection of Jesus so there are many similarities between Norway and the United States but there are also differences. We do live in a very connected world and traditions tend to spread whether that be organically or due to corporate marketing.</description>

      <title>Mailing Lists Transitioning to Forum</title>

      <description>Shawnee Skogen Members,
In an ironic twist, after finally just bulk adding everyone to the mailing lists, I have discovered a major technical hurdle which means I&amp;rsquo;ll have to transition to an alternate solution for online discussion. Therefore, I have removed the link to the &amp;ldquo;Mailing Lists&amp;rdquo; on the sidebar and replaced it with a link to our &amp;ldquo;Forum&amp;rdquo; instead. I&amp;rsquo;ll be testing the forum server over the coming days/weeks to avoid repeating my mistake.</description>

      <description>For September we met at Giant City State Park and the weather was absolutely sublime. After taking care of the formal lodge meeting we continued on with a presentation from Wendy about the state and relations of the royal families of Europe.
After the presentation we played a game of Kubb which purports to be an ancient Viking game. It was introduced to our lodge via Nordic Fest which sometimes hosts a Kubb tournament.</description>

      <description>Every year Norwegians celebrate Constitution Day often referred to just as &amp;ldquo;syttende mai&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Seventeenth May&amp;rdquo;). In Norway the day will feature children&amp;rsquo;s parades all over the country, memorials to those fallen in wars, and russ. Men, women, and children often wear traditional outfits called bunad or wear red, white and blue ribbons and carry flags. Around the world Norwegian communities celebrate with traditional foods and in some cases putting on their own parades and festivities.</description>

      <title>Annual Lefse Making Meeting November 15, 2020</title>
      <link>https://shawnee-skogen.com/p/2020-11-15-lefse/</link>

      <guid>https://shawnee-skogen.com/p/2020-11-15-lefse/</guid>
      <description>Every year we make lefse,
 Lefse is a traditional soft Norwegian flatbread. It is made with potatoes (often, but not always), flour, butter, and milk or cream. It is cooked on a large, flat griddle. Special tools are used to prepare lefse, including long wooden turning sticks and special rolling pins with deep grooves.
 It&amp;rsquo;s almost like a flour tortilla but softer and tastier and Norwegian!
Consider joining our lodge so you can learn to make lefse and all sorts of other Scandinavian art, food, etc.</description>
