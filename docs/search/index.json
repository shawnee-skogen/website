For many of us this is a major milestone on the road to returning to normal and offers hope to being able to resume in-person lodge meetings. Between vaccines being available and the weather allowing us to meet outdoors we hope to see familiar faces in-person soon!\n","date":"2021-03-30T19:00:00-05:00","permalink":"https://shawnee-skogen.com/p/2021-04-12-vaccine/","title":"COVID-19 Vaccinations Open to Any Illinois Resident Age 16 and up on April 12th"},{"content":"Every year Norwegians celebrate Constitution Day often referred to just as \u0026ldquo;syttende mai\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;Seventeenth May\u0026rdquo;). In Norway the day will feature children\u0026rsquo;s parades all over the country, memorials to those fallen in wars, and russ. Men, women, and children often wear traditional outfits called bunad or wear red, white and blue ribbons and carry flags. Around the world Norwegian communities celebrate with traditional foods and in some cases putting on their own parades and festivities.\nThis year we will not only be celebrating syttende mai but also our postponed julebord! Normally julebord would happen in early December but because of COVID-19 we postponed it. With vaccinations being widely available and with our May 16th meeting being planned outdoors at Giant City State Park we think it will be safe to come together to celebrate syttende mai and our postponed julebord!\nWe will be at Shelter 3 right beside the Giant City Nature Trail trailhead at 2PM.\n","date":"2021-03-28T15:00:00-05:00","image":"https://shawnee-skogen.com/p/2021-03-28-syttende-mai/1080px-Oslo_17_mai_2010_hu47bf62724ef8d199649f8de504a87417_217623_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://shawnee-skogen.com/p/2021-03-28-syttende-mai/","title":"Annual Syttende Mai Meeting May 16, 2021"},{"content":"Every year we make lefse,\n Lefse is a traditional soft Norwegian flatbread. It is made with potatoes (often, but not always), flour, butter, and milk or cream. It is cooked on a large, flat griddle. Special tools are used to prepare lefse, including long wooden turning sticks and special rolling pins with deep grooves.\n It\u0026rsquo;s almost like a flour tortilla but softer and tastier and Norwegian!\nConsider joining our lodge so you can learn to make lefse and all sorts of other Scandinavian art, food, etc.\nOur annual lefse making meeting will be November 15, 2020 at 2:00 PM.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the recipe we will use,\n 9 cup hot water 3 sticks butter (2 butter, 1 margarine) 5 tsp. salt 3 Tbsp. sugar 3 cup dried milk 9 cup potato flakes (Idaho or Hungry Jack)   Mix above together real good. I use a mixer. Put in covered rectangular container. Cool overnight. Divide into thirds. Knead in 1 1/2 cup flour in each 1/3. Then make it into a roll about 2 1/2\u0026quot; diameter. Cut in half, each half in half, and so on until you have 16 patties (in each 1/3). Roll and put on grill.  This recipe will make 48 patties.\n","date":"2020-10-18T21:30:00-06:00","image":"https://shawnee-skogen.com/p/2020-11-15-lefse/4ADF4300-3BC4-4251-A289-6B363B1C1638_hu08ded00b49867214ce85bd17017f9d4a_4535629_120x120_fill_box_smart1_2.png","permalink":"https://shawnee-skogen.com/p/2020-11-15-lefse/","title":"Annual Lefse Making Meeting November 15, 2020"}]
