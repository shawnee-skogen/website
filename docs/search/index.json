[{"content":"Every year we make lefse,\n Lefse is a traditional soft Norwegian flatbread. It is made with potatoes (often, but not always), flour, butter, and milk or cream. It is cooked on a large, flat griddle. Special tools are used to prepare lefse, including long wooden turning sticks and special rolling pins with deep grooves.\n It\u0026rsquo;s almost like a flour tortilla but softer and tastier and Norwegian!\nConsider joining our lodge so you can learn to make lefse and all sorts of other Scandinavian art, food, etc.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the recipe we used,\n 9 cup hot water 3 sticks butter (2 butter, 1 margarine) 5 tsp. salt 3 Tbsp. sugar 3 cup dried milk 9 cup potato flakes (Idaho or Hungry Jack)   Mix above together real good. I use a mixer. Put in covered rectangular container. Cool overnight. Divide into thirds. Knead in 1 1/2 cup flour in each 1/3. Then make it into a roll about 2 1/2\u0026quot; diameter. Cut in half, each half in half, and so on until you have 16 patties (in each 1/3). Roll and put on grill.  This recipe will make 48 patties.\n","date":"2020-11-15T21:30:00-06:00","image":"https://shawnee-skogen.com/p/lefse-2020/4ADF4300-3BC4-4251-A289-6B363B1C1638_hu08ded00b49867214ce85bd17017f9d4a_4535629_120x120_fill_box_smart1_2.png","permalink":"https://shawnee-skogen.com/p/lefse-2020/","title":"Lefse 2020"}]
