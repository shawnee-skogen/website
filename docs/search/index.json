[{"content":"Påskestradisjoner just means \u0026ldquo;Easter Traditions\u0026rdquo;. Even when the same holidays are celebrated in different cultures there are often little, interesting differences. Easter has its roots as a spring festival and from Christianity with the resurrection of Jesus so there are many similarities between Norway and the United States but there are also differences. We do live in a very connected world and traditions tend to spread whether that be organically or due to corporate marketing. One tradition that is somewhat unique to Norway is påskekrim (Easter Crime). In contrast, the Easter Bunny is not very common in Norway; at least not yet.\nPåskekrim (Easter Crime) It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be an Easter holiday in Norway without the tradition of reading gripping crime novels. This unusual combination dates back to 1923, when publisher Gyldendal pulled a media stunt to boost spring book sales. The ploy worked and a national ritual was born.\nMany Norwegians head to the hytte (cabin) over Easter break and their laid-back vacation days pair well reading by the fire. Each spring, various publishers release special collections of novellas called Påskekrim along with many full-length novels. Other media channels have followed suit, producing crime radio plays, TV shows, films, and podcasts.\nNorwegian Arts has an article, Påskekrim: Norway’s Mysterious Easter Custom, which goes into more depth on this tradition.\nMilk Carton Mysteries Since 1997, TINE dairy cooperative has printed family-friendly whodunit comics on their milk cartons for Norwegians to solve over breakfast during Easter break. Private detective Ulf Ulvheim (en ulv – a wolf, naturally) has been a recurring character in the Easter-related detective strips (see cover image). Famous crime writers such as Jo Nesbø, Anne Holt, Gunnar Staalesen, and others have authored the storylines. As of 2021, the milk mysteries went digital, to the consternation of many citizens.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if TINE has brought back the milk carton comics. If Påskenøttene som forsvant is current then it implies they have but that they\u0026rsquo;re also posting the digital comic: \u0026ldquo;Har du ikke lest påskekrimmen på melkekartongen enda? Da kan du lese den her\u0026rdquo; translates to \u0026ldquo;Haven\u0026rsquo;t read the Easter Crime on the milk carton yet? You can read it here\u0026rdquo;.\nIt also looks like private detective Ulf Ulvheim may have been replaced by a rabbit and chicks which may be a sign of the growing popularity of the Easter Bunny in Norway.\nNorwegian Lesson: Påskestradisjoner A YouTube channel I enjoy, Norwegian Teacher - Karin has a language lesson video on Easter traditions. Because it\u0026rsquo;s meant to be a language lesson she tends to speak clearly/simply. You can turn on auto-translated English captions if you want to try to learn a few words. Regardless, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably enjoy this brief video highlighting some of their family Easter traditions.\n Påskeoppskrifter (Easter Recipes) If you come across a recipe in Norwegian you can translate the webpage with Google Translate; for example, Kvikklunsjkake. Like modern chefs do powdered ingredients are often measured by mass/weight instead of volume so the g is grams and you\u0026rsquo;ll need a food scale. dl is deciliter which is 1/10 of a liter which is a bit less than 3.5 fl. oz and 2.5 dl is a bit more than one cup. 180º C is about 350º F. Just use Siri, Alexa, or Google to do unit conversion and round appropriately.\nSometimes ingredients are used that are not as common in the US but you can search online for alternatives. Adapt, be creative, and have fun!\nTINE has a bunch of Easter recipes on their God Påske page. You could also search for påskemat (Easter food) or påskeoppskrifter (Easter recipes) to find more.\nIf you make something, please take a picture and share with the lodge!\nRead More Life in Norway has a page on Easter Traditions in Norway. By the way, Life in Norway also has a nice podcast and YouTube channel.\n Påskekrim milk carton comic photo by Ole Martin Buene/Tine via nationen.no.\nSome copy provided by the Sons of Norway newsletter service.\n ","date":"2022-04-10T13:00:00-05:00","image":"https://shawnee-skogen.com/p/2022-04-10-pasketradisjoner/index_huafd631de480cd6db126ed3ed0dff8cdc_2307754_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://shawnee-skogen.com/p/2022-04-10-pasketradisjoner/","title":"Påskestradisjoner"},{"content":"Shawnee Skogen Members,\nIn an ironic twist, after finally just bulk adding everyone to the mailing lists, I have discovered a major technical hurdle which means I\u0026rsquo;ll have to transition to an alternate solution for online discussion. Therefore, I have removed the link to the \u0026ldquo;Mailing Lists\u0026rdquo; on the sidebar and replaced it with a link to our \u0026ldquo;Forum\u0026rdquo; instead. I\u0026rsquo;ll be testing the forum server over the coming days/weeks to avoid repeating my mistake.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re curious about the nerdy details continue reading\u0026hellip;\nI wanted to use mailing lists because email is something everyone, more-or-less, already knows how to use. However, it turns out that running a mailing list server is harder than I expected because of all the safeguards the internet has created to fight spam. I could possibly address each issue but it would be a long time before I could ensure all members could receive the emails from the mailing list server. Essentially, the mailing list server is not trusted by the email servers of each member\u0026rsquo;s email provider. I would have to one-by-one appeal to each email provider to permit our mailing list server to send email to them.\nThere is an alternative is to send email from an already-trusted server but to do that you have to verify the identity of each person allowed to send mail through that server. This would be a significant technical burden on each member which makes it infeasible.\nAnother alternative is I can switch to a more web browser oriented alternative which can still send and receive emails but acts as an explicit middleman. Since it is an explicit middleman I can use an already-trusted server and verify that middleman\u0026rsquo;s identity.\nIt turns out there may be some positives from this surprise:\n I may be able to reduce the cost 25%. The prior mailing lists did have a web browser app to view the message archives but the new solution seems much nicer. The new solution took me a lot less time to set up which hopefully means it\u0026rsquo;ll be easier to keep running.  The old solution was Mailman and the new solution is Discourse.\nIt may be worth re-answering the question, \u0026ldquo;Why not use social media like Reddit or Facebook?\u0026rdquo; The main reason would be wanting to start growing an archive of our history that new and existing members will have access to. For example, easy access to all our old newsletters, all the shared recipes, etc. My experience with Facebook is that it is very oriented towards the present moment. Reddit might actually work reasonably well but Discourse does still give us an email interface and more control.\nRegards,\nNathan Nutter\n","date":"2022-03-13T23:30:00-05:00","permalink":"https://shawnee-skogen.com/p/2022-03-13-music/","title":"Mailing Lists Transitioning to Forum"},{"content":"Part of Sons of Norway is a pin system for various activities primarily falling under two programs: Cultural Skills and Sports Medals.

Solfager, however, is engaged to David, and as such Ormekongen conjures up a cunning plan. He gives Solafager an anesthetic drink, causing her to fall into a deep sleep. It is quickly assumed that Solafager has died, and David and his folk proceed to bury the beautiful Solfager. Once buried, Ormekongen visits Solfager’s grave and gives her a choice: She can die there alone or join him without anyone suspecting she is under his command. Fearing for her life Solfager chooses to join Ormekongen. David soon learns that she is alive and comes to her rescue and kills Ormekongen. As such, David’s love for Solafager does not only release her from a life in barbaric captivity, but he also conquers death and proves that true love is eternal.”\n And the lyrics to Solfager om Ormekongen,\n David kongjen kom seg riand i går\nSolfager to ute og sola sitt hår\nHan støypte gullkrossen i solfagers hond,\nAt ho sill` vera kjend på fremminde lond\nOrmekongjen kom seg riand i går Solfager sto ute, ho sola sitt hår\nSå gav han henne dei dvaledrykkjin` tri\nSolfager ho dåna, då ho fekk di\nKongen let seg pilmrimsklæ`i skjera\nLiksom ein pilgrim han vera\nSolfager ho lyfte på pilgrimshatt\n«Er du kongjen, du seie meg satt.»\n Learn more about Gåte on Wikipedia.\nMari Boine - Vuoi Vuoi Me Mari Boine is a Norwegian Sámi singer who combined traditional Sámi joik singing with rock, electronic, etc. Vuoi Vuoi Me is her most popular song on Apple Music.\n Learn more about Mari Boine on Wikipedia.\nBonus: SKÁLD - Þat Mælti Mín Móðir SKÁLD takes inspiration from the poetry of the ancient skalds who sang and told stories of the Vikings and their gods.
