It was wonderful to see everyone but in particular a couple members we haven\u0026rsquo;t seen in a long time as well as several newer members for which this was their first or second in-person meeting.\nWe got to enjoy a special guided tour by Margarette, former site director and a French colonial archaeologist, who offered us a font of wisdom. She introduced us to the Mississippian culture of this ancient city that existed around 1050-1350 CE. We learned about the layout of the city, its defenses, the purposes of the mounds, etc. Rolling in on the heels of our guided tour were some thunderstorms which prevented us from hiking up Monks Mound; until next time!\n Monks Mound \nWe finished off the guided tour and headed into the extremely welcoming, cooly air conditioned museum full of artifacts and exhibits.

Around the world Norwegian communities celebrate with traditional foods and in some cases putting on their own parades and festivities.\nThis year we will not only be celebrating syttende mai but also our postponed julebord! Normally julebord would happen in early December but because of COVID-19 we postponed it.
